--->*Problem* *statement* 
      Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, has become a popular investment option 
due to its high potential for return on investment. However, the price of Bitcoin is 
highly volatile and can be affected by a wide range of factors, making it challenging 
for investors to predict its price accurately. Traditional methods of price prediction 
have not been very successful, and thus, there is a need for new approaches to predict 
the price of Bitcoin. One potential solution is to use deep learning algorithms to predict 
the price of Bitcoin. Deep learning algorithms have shown great promise in predicting 
complex and non-linear patterns, making them ideal for predicting the highly volatile 
Bitcoin price. Furthermore, the use of a web application to display the predictions can 
increase accessibility and convenience for investors.

Therefore, the problem statement is to develop a deep learning algorithm that 
can accurately predict the price of Bitcoin and to integrate it into a web application 
that can be used by investors to make informed investment decisions. 


-->*Summary* 
      Financial risk management by predicting cryptocurrency 
prices using deep learning reviews a range of deep learning models including Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Attention Mechanisms, and Transformers. These 
models are extensively analyzed for their ability to discern and predict complex patterns 
in cryptocurrency price fluctuations. The survey highlights not only the strengths of these 
models in handling time-series data but also discusses their limitations such as 
susceptibility to overfitting, challenges in generalization across various 
cryptocurrencies, and the unpredictability introduced by external factors affecting the 
markets. 

Furthermore, the survey delves into the practical challenges associated with 
deploying these models, such as the scarcity of standardized and comprehensive data 
sets, and the ethical and regulatory implications of using AI in financial markets. Issues 
such as data privacy, potential for market manipulation, and the need for compliance 
with financial regulations are examined. Future research directions suggested include 
developing more robust models capable of adapting to new market conditions, 
improving model transparency and interpretability, and innovating in data collection and 
preprocessing to enhance the predictive power of these models.
